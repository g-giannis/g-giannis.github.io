# About me
I am Ioannis (aka Giannis) a passionate iOS Developer from Greece living in beautiful Berlin! 
Whether you're here to learn more about my professional endeavors or simply looking for inspiration for your own hobbies, I hope you'll find something that resonates with you. 😅 

During my free time, I love to engage in a variety of hobbies that allow me to express my creativity and broaden my horizons. 

As an avid photographer, I enjoy capturing the beauty of the world around me through my lens. 📷 When I'm not behind the camera, I can often be found coding iOS/macOS applications, honing my skills as a programmer. 👨🏻‍💻 

In addition to my passion for technology, I also have a keen interest in investing, always seeking new opportunities to grow my wealth and knowledge. 

When I'm not busy managing my investments, I enjoy exploring my culinary skills by cooking up delicious recipes in the kitchen, experimenting with flavors and ingredients to create mouthwatering dishes. 🤤👨🏻‍🍳 

Last but not least, I also love DJing and creating music that keeps people dancing and energized. 🕺🏻🎉

Stay tuned for more updates on my hobbies and adventures! Thank you for visiting! 🙏🏻
